## ðŸ“‹ About The Project

This dashboard was built in python using Plotly and Dash, as a way of learning new data visualisation libraries and basic front-end web development skills, whilst also honing existing foundational knowledge of python.

The dashboard is exploratory in nature, allowing the user to leverage the interactive page elements at their discretion to apply filters, view detailed tooltips, drill-down using cross-filtering capabilities, and toggle between alternate visualisation options, ultimately enabling the discovery of a depth of insights.
